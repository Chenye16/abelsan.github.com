    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just watched &#8220;Memory Profiling with Chrome DevTools&#8221;. I enjoyed the video a lot. You can see the building blocks for great debugging coming together in the browser. Kudos to the &#8220;Developer Tools&#8221; team at Google.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched my phone account to TMobile prepaid services. I liked the freedom of not being tied to a carrier and limiting my information disclosure. I did everything online. I went as far as not giving them my credit card and using a disposable visa card each time.</p>

<p>Everything went well my first time.</p>

<p>The second time, the payment page kept complaining about my disposable visa. After many tries and phone calls it worked.</p>

<p>My third time did not work. Frustrated, I used my standard card. TMobile placed a hold on my transaction three times in a row.</p>

<p>I called TMobile and they requested my birthday, my car model and year, and SSN. I complained. I got no sympathy.</p>

<p>At that point I had two choices. Cancel my account or handover my information. I cancelled my account.</p>

<p>I am so happy I use a Google Number, the abstraction allows me to change my phone service at will.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few people have asked me about the changes taking place in education. In the posting below, Clay Shirky does a good job capturing the disruption taking place in academia<br>
<a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/">http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/</a><p>

<p>
I was struck by the following paragraph
<div style="font-style:italic;">We have several advantages over the recording industry, of course. We are decentralized and mostly non-profit. We employ lots of smart people. We have previous examples to learn from, and our core competence is learning from the past. And armed with these advantages, we’re probably going to screw this up as badly as the music people did.</div></p>

<p>
I am more optimistic. I see a lot of enthusiasm and exciting experiments being done internally. Will our institutions react in time to take advantage of these new ideas? The established pattern has been to let the innovators prove their worth in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The students of my class did a great job answering the question in video form. They are Rory, Pierre, and Rachelle – see below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great article by a group that has been creating scaleable sites for many years - they did <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Their idea is simple, CMS&#8217; are too complex and expensive to be sustainable over the long run. They claim the can achieve the same with static pages and a <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/">light tool for production</a>.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about the same but using <a href="http://octopress.org/"></a>Octopress instead of the Prose.io tool they mention.</p>

<p>Makes a lot of sense, we have come full circle.</p>
