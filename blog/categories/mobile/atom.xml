    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched my phone account to TMobile prepaid services. I liked the freedom of not being tied to a carrier and limiting my information disclosure. I did everything online. I went as far as not giving them my credit card and using a disposable visa card each time.</p>

<p>Everything went well my first time.</p>

<p>The second time, the payment page kept complaining about my disposable visa. After many tries and phone calls it worked.</p>

<p>My third time did not work. Frustrated, I used my standard card. TMobile placed a hold on my transaction three times in a row.</p>

<p>I called TMobile and they requested my birthday, my car model and year, and SSN. I complained. I got no sympathy.</p>

<p>At that point I had two choices. Cancel my account or handover my information. I cancelled my account.</p>

<p>I am so happy I use a Google Number, the abstraction allows me to change my phone service at will.</p>
