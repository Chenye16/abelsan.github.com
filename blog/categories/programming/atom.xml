    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mark Twain famously said, "The difference between the almost right word &amp; the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."</p>

<p>When it comes to naming variables, objects, functions, classes, and namespaces, the same applies.</p>

<p>Clarity and expressiveness come with experience. However, the beginner can still learn a lot by looking at conventions, best practices, reading code from peers, and thinking hard about a word that best express the programmer's intent.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a teacher, your first and most important goal is to capture the attention of the listener. If you fail, nothing else will matter.</p>

<p>The techniques vary from speaker to speaker but invariable they comprise volume, timing, suspense, and tone. For example, a colleague once told me, "lowering your voice is like using bold on text".</p>

<p>When it comes to writing, a similar process takes place. I have been reading, "Unless It Moves the Human Heart: The Craft and Art of Writing". Much like in teaching, if we fail to make the human connection, we loose our audience.</p>

<p>Khan was on campus recently. In one of his answers, I heard the same argument:
<blockquote><p>I cannot understate the fact that I was making it for my cousin. The fact that I was their tutor, that I had a human connection when I was making the videos. If I were making these for Bill Gates, I would have messed up. I would have fallen into the trap of high production. I would have needed a team of script writers, a team of computer graphics engineers, and voice over actors. The output of that process looks great but but does not feel very human.</p><footer><strong>Khan</strong> <cite>Key to Success</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the following last night. It strikes me we could substitute writing for programming and it would hold.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>For decades researchers have been telling us that "the teaching of formal grammar has a negligible or . . . even a harmful effect on the teaching of writing" (Richard Braddock, Richard Lloyd-Jones, Lowell Schoer, Research in Written Composition, 1963). I agree if by "the teaching of formal grammar" is meant memorizing the parts of speech or rehearsing the distinction between dependent and independent clauses or listing the uses of the subjunctive. That kind of rote knowledge is merely taxonomic. It explains nothing; students who acquire it have learned nothing about how to write, and it is no surprise when research demonstrate its nonutility.</p><footer><strong>Stanley Fish</strong> <cite>How to Write a Sentence</cite></footer></blockquote></p>
